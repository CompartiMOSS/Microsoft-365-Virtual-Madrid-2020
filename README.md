# Microsoft-365-Virtual-Madrid-2020
Due to the very special circumstances that surround us this year we have decided to postpone our traditional SharePoint Saturday Madrid for when circumstances allow it and hold this event virtually, so that anyone can participate regardless of where they are.  Submit compelling sessions about SharePoint, Office 365 or Azure and join the community on April 30.
